#### Code Examples ####
//* Write a function which returns the factorial of the parameter being passed i.e. FirstFactorial(4) should return 24 (4x3x2x1 =24)  
//* Write a function which returns the reverse of a string given as a parameter being passed i.e. reverse('hello') should return 'olleH'  
* Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.
* Write a JavaScript program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user)
* Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched"
* Write a Regular Expression pattern to match a date in a string: ie. let str = "01/01/2017" (determine whether a string is a date or not)
